Mega atlasser

- Supports textures using repeat
- Supports mipmap levels
- Supports standard shader

- Adds texture girder to prevent weird borders when repeating tiles
- Supports color tinting of textures
- Correctly merges geometry of complex hierarchies

- Transfers baked lightmap UVs for a quick merge process
  - Considers mesh surface size and scale in scene
  - You still need to bake lightmaps afterwards
- Supports simplified standard shader with Diffuse, Normals, Occlusion, Metallic/Specular, Color-Tint (also on mobile)
  - no support for Emission and Detail-maps
- Respects shader texture default colors
- Collider creation support
	- Merges simple colliders with mesh colliders
	- Supports: Box, Sphere, Capsule, Wheel and Terrain colliders
- BETA: Shader Patcher to create your alpha shader from a giben shader automatically!
	
	
	

3D Collider Utility

Simply create a merged collider of a single gamebject or the entire hierachy with a single click.

Developed in 2020.1 compatible down to 2017.3

- Supports runtime and editor

- Support all kinds of collider types.
  - box collider
  - sphere collider
  - capsule collider
  - wheel collider
  - terrain collider (creates simplified version of your terrain through vertex decimation algorithm while preserving edges)
  - mesh collider (support for convex mesh colliders due to convex hull algorithm)
  
- Simple API 
  void ColliderUtility.ToCollider(gameObject) 
  void ColliderUtility.ToMesh(gameObject)
  Mesh ColliderUtility.Create(gameObject)
